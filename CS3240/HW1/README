CS3240 Homework Project 1 by Eric Fruchter

To run/clean the project, simply use the makefile.
You must have Java 6+ installed in order to run the code.

All of the classes are heavily commented, but to get started you can refer
to DocumentStatistics.java, where the actual information is requested and
recorded. The scanning and parsing is done by TokenScanner.java.
When you feed the scanner a file, only one line of the file is loaded
into memory at a time, preventing large RAM usage from occurring.

Homework1Test is a JUnit test, which I used along with TestFile.txt, 
and WarAndPeace.txt to test my parser and scanner, initially.

ExtraCredit.java generates document length differences based on top-K-replace.
