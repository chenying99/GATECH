This is my constrained particles project for my Animation course at Georgia Tech.
It's written in Java and is based on Thomas Jakobsen's paper "Advanced Character Physics".

Under the package "sample", you can find the following code examples:
1. Integrator Test
2. SnowGlobe simulation
3. Cloth Physics Simulation
