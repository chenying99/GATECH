Realism
Tolstoy incorporated extensive historical research.
He was also influenced by many other novels.
[9] A veteran of the Crimean War, Tolstoy was quite critical of standard history,
especially the standards of military history, in War and Peace. Tolstoy read all the
standard histories available in Russian and French about the Napoleonic Wars and combined
more traditional historical writing with the novel form. He explains at the start of the
novel's third volume his own views on how history ought to be written. His aim was to blur
the line between fiction and history, in order to get closer to the truth, as he states in Volume II.
The novel is set 60 years earlier than the time at which Tolstoy wrote it,
"in the days of our grandfathers", as he puts it. He had spoken with people who had lived
through war during the French invasion of Russia in 1812, so the book is also, in part, accurate
ethnography fictionalized. He read letters, journals, autobiographical and biographical materials
pertaining to Napoleon and the dozens of other historical characters in the novel.
There are approximately 160 real persons named or referred to in War and Peace.[11]
